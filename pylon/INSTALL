Installation Guide for pylon 6.x Camera Software Suite for Linux
================================================================


To install the pylon 6 Camera Software Suite for Linux, you need the
correct installation package for your architecture. Basler provides packages
for x86, x86_64, armhf, and arm64 platforms.

This installation procedure assumes that you are going to install the
pylon Camera Software Suite in the /opt/pylon directory. If you choose
to install in a different directory, you'll have to modify the 
directory names accordingly.
Note: Root permissions are needed to write to /opt.

To install the pylon 6 Camera Software Suite in /opt/pylon
follow these steps:

  1. Change to the directory that contains this INSTALL document.

  2. Extract the pylon SDK into /opt/pylon:
      sudo tar -C /opt/pylon -xzf ./pylon_*.tar.gz

  3. Change access rights of the pylon folder:
      sudo chmod 755 /opt/pylon
      
USB3 Vision cameras
-------------------
In order to use USB3 Vision cameras, you also need to install the udev-rules to
set up permissions for Basler USB cameras by calling:
      sudo /opt/pylon/share/pylon/setup-usb.sh

After that, unplug and replug all USB cameras to get the udev rules applied.

CoaXPress cameras (x86_64 only)
-------------------------------
For operating CoaXPress cameras, a driver must be installed first. After the 
installation of the pylon 6 Camera Software Suite, this driver can be found in
/opt/pylon/share/pylon/menable-driver-*.tar.gz.

To install the CoaXPress driver, follow these steps: 

  1. Change to the directory where you want to extract the driver to.
  
  2. Extract the driver archive:
      sudo tar -C ./ -xzf /opt/pylon/share/pylon/menable-driver-*.tar.gz
      
  3. Follow the instructions in the ./menable-driver-*/linux/INSTALL file.
      
You need to reboot your system in order to load the driver.

When starting an application (e.g., the pylon Viewer) that requires CoaXPress
support, the GENICAM_GENTLXX_PATH environment variable (GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH for
32-bit Systems and GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH for 64-bit systems) must be set.
The /opt/pylon/share/pylon/README document explains how to set this variable. 

Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 (optional)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 is an optional component that
contains libraries for encoding MPEG-4 video files. You need to download
this package separately from the Basler website in order to be able to create
MPEG-4 files with pylon.
